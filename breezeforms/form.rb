module Silverplatter
	module BreezeForms
		# === Attributes:
		# * name: the name by which the form can be accessed. The same page should not
		#   use multiple forms of the same name as the form processor won't be able
		#   to distinguish them (see BreezeForms#process_form)
		# 
		# === Flags:
		# * prevent_multipost: prevents a form to be processed multiple times, this can
		#   e.g. happen if the latency is too high so the user thinks the form hasn't been
		#   sent after he pressed the submit button and presses it again. But in fact the
		#   form has been processed the first time already. Prevent_multipost now sends
		#   a hidden hash value to the server along the form, if that hash value is received
		#   again, it is ignored
		# * sessionized: all form values are stored in the session, so when the form
		#   is opened again during the same session, those values are used instead of
		#   the default values
		# * 
		# 
		# == Example
		#   class MyForm < Form
		#     name   "myform"
		#     action '/process/myform'
		#     method :post
		#     prevent_multipost
		#     
		#     with_fields do
		#       on_error do
		#         add_class 'error' # add 'error' to the 'class' attribute on errors
		#       end
		#     
		#       hidden :sid do
		#         value { request.session_id } #Â use a dynamic value
		#       end
		#     
		#       text :mail do
		#         validates_if String, :valid_email
		#       end
		#   
		#       select :item do
		#         options [
		#           ['item1_value', 'item1_text'],
		#           ['item2_value', 'item2_text'],
		#           ['item3_value', 'item3_text'],
		#         ]
		#         # will validate that the submitted value is one of the option-values
		#         validate_options
		#       end
		#     
		#       checkbox :agree do
		#         required # the input must be submitted
		#         value "yes"
		#         validates_if String, :is => "yes"
